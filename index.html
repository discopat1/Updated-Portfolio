      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="images/Head-shot-long-hair.jpg" class="rounded float-right" alt="image">
      <p>As a seasoned veteran in the world of beverage sales and customer service, success has come to me over the years through hard work and an extraordinary attitude.  Having a personality that displayed a combination of relatable and inspiring traits played an integral role in building and maintaining professional relationships which, in turn, led to maximizing sales. On top of having success in my sales roles I also demonstrated leadership qualities and the ability to excel in challenging situations. A desire to take on new challenges led me the opportunity to lead a team of 30 employees while also building capability so that some of those employees could also move on to greater roles.</p>

      <p>If someone had told me 10 years ago that today I would be writing code for hours at a time and loving it I would have told them they were crazy. For someone who has never had much interest in computers or video games or any such things it is incredible to me that I have this newfound passion for coding. The need for a career change after spending years in a failing industry led me to this path but the enjoyment of new problems to solve and challenges to overcome is what keeps me inspired. My goal with every new technology I learn is to find a way to use it to fill some void or solve some problem in our society. I think that the potential to help others with what I’m learning is one of my strongest motivators. Problem solving has, in fact, become my favorite part about coding. I have a long track record of learning new things and taking up difficult disciplines as hobbies.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>My greatest passion in life for over 15 years has been my martial arts practice. It has presented me with many difficult and frustrating situations but I have also learned to get past such situations in the rest of my life because of my ability and patience to overcome those. I’ve also been fortunate enough because of my experience to be put in many teaching situations where I can pass on knowledge to and inspire others. I have introduced both of my kids to this same world of discipline and new experiences and that is just one way that we like to spend our time together. When I’m not training, working, or spending time with my kids I can usually be found playing the violin, hiking, playing disc golf, or exploring one of Colorado’s fine breweries.</p>
