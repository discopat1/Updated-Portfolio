      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="images/Head-shot-long-hair.jpg" class="rounded float-right" alt="image">
      <p>I am a high performing, goal oriented, individual with leadership skills and a willingness to learn new things. In the past I have been in the 1st percentile for my designated roles which has helped prepare me and propel me into further roles with greater responsibility. I excel at working with others in collaborative efforts and finding solutions to difficult problems using a variety of methods. One of my favorite technical practices is breaking down daunting, large tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks.  Some of my greatest attributes are my discipline, strategic planning, pattern recognition, and forecasting. In the future I hope to work on projects that align with my values, while from a technical standpoint increasing user experience including but not limited to time saving functionalities.</p> 
      <hr>
      <p>For someone who has never had much interest in computers or video games or any such things it is incredible to me that I have this newfound passion for coding. My goal with every new technology I learn is to find a way to use it to fill some void or solve some problem in our society. I think that the potential to help others with what I’m learning is one of my strongest motivators. I have a long track record of learning new things and taking up difficult disciplines as hobbies.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>For over 15 years I have been a martial arts practitioner. It has presented me with many difficult and frustrating situations but it also taught me to develop patience in the face of such adversity. I’ve also been fortunate enough because of my experience to be put in many teaching situations where I can pass on knowledge and inspire others. I have introduced both of my kids to this same world of discipline and new experiences and that is just one way that we like to spend our time together. When I’m not training, working, or spending time with my kids I can usually be found playing the violin, hiking, playing disc golf, or exploring one of Colorado’s fine breweries.</p>
